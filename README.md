<i>WARNING! This is a research project and a lot of information here might become outdated and misleading without any explanation. Don't use it for anything important!</i>

<i>Update (June 26, 2017): The total rewrite is now live; if you want to look at the old version, it's under the branch named "c" in this repository.</i>

## About

Carp is a small programming language designed to work well for interactive and performance sensitive use cases like games, sound synthesis and visualizations.

The key features of Carp are the following:
* Automatic and deterministic memory management (no garbage collector or VM)
* Inferred static types for great speed and reliability
* Ownership tracking enables a functional programming style while still using mutation of cache-friendly data structures under the hood
* No hidden performance penalties – allocation and copying are explicit
* Straightforward integration with existing C code

* [The Compiler Manual](docs/Manual.md) - how to compile code and configure your projects
* [Carp Language Guide](docs/LanguageGuide.md) - syntax and semantics of the language
* [Libraries](docs/Libraries.md) - how to work with libraries and modules
* [Tooling](docs/Tooling.md) - supported editors

The Carp REPL has built-in documentation, run ```(help)``` to access it!

## A Very Small Example

```clojure
(load-and-use SDL)

(defn tick [state]
  (+ state 10))

(defn draw [app rend state]
  (bg rend &(rgb (/ @state 2) (/ @state 3) (/ @state 4))))

(defn main []
  (let [app (SDLApp.create "The Minimalistic Color Generator" 400 300)
        state 0]
    (SDLApp.run-with-callbacks &app SDLApp.quit-on-esc tick draw state)))
```

To build this example, save it to a file called 'example.carp' and load it with ```(load "example.carp")```, then execute ```(build)``` to build an executable, and ```(run)``` to start.
