## Working with libraries and modules

Below is a list of 'core' modules that comes included with the Carp compiler.
Modules marked with the symbol '⦁' are imported by default, other modules must be imported by loading their file. For example, to get access to the Bench module, do the following:

```clojure
(load "Bench.carp")
```

Using the functions in the Bench module still requires pre-pending them with the module name, i.e. `(Bench.bench fib)`. To avoid that, also do `(use Bench)`.

To see what functions a certain module contains, use the `info` command:

```clojure
(info "Bench")
```

External librares can be loaded by using their relative or absolute location in your file system as the path. To make a library publically available in a more general way you can add it to your Carp project's search path:s (found by running `:p` in the repl). For instance, here's how you would add the NCurses library so that it can be loaded with just `(load "NCurses.carp")`.

```clojure
(Project.config "search-path" "~/Projects/carp-ncurses")
```

This line of configuration can be put into a `~/.carp/profile.carp` file to make it apply in all your projects.
